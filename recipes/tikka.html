        <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Start by preparing the chicken tikka. Add 1tbsp of tikka paste to the chicken 
                and coat all of the pieces. Leave to marinate while you are preparing the masala.</li>
            <li>Add oil and butter to a pan over a medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add in the onions 
                and ginger garlic paste. Stir until the onions start to brown.</li>
            <li>Next add in the chilli powder, turmeric, cumin, coriander powder, salt and lemon juice. 
                Mix well and leave the spices to cook for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Add in the chopped tomatoes and cook on a low heat until the liquid has slightly reduced.</li>
            <li>While the masala is cooking, bake or fry the chips until golden.</li>
            <li>At this point you can also put the chicken on skewers and grill for around 10 minutes. 
                Be sure to turn the skewers over halfway through and allow to cook until the chicken has slightly charred.</li>
            <li>Once the fries are crispy and golden, add them to the masala and mix well so that all the fries are coated well.</li>
            <li>Transfer them to a serving plate and top with dollops of yoghurt, chopped coriander, sliced chillies and spring onions.</li>
